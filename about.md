A C++ & Python programmer is actively seeking summer intern opportunities in Software Engineering and Data Engineering for 2022 Summer! I am a sophomore student studying Electrical & Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University with an additional major in Computer Science. Efficiently and confidently, I can write proficient C and Python and implement various algorithms and data structures with 2 years of hands-on experience. I used to work as a responsible teaching assistant, skillful at troubleshooting and fast debugging, plus excellent interpersonal communication skills. For now, I am taking more in-depth computer system courses, and I want to pursue a career in software engineering in the future.

Outside of the classroom, I enjoy photography and nature. I love to capture its lights and shades in my life. I also enjoy singing and dancing. They bring as much joy to me as coding as.
